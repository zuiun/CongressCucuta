bind title of SimulationWindow to state name
display textblock on FileWindow if file fails
Line needs to wrap overflow
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
many objects need to be convertible to Slides
ownerID 255 is the state (eg Tension, Stability, etc), other ownerIDs refer to factions
a ballot/result that links to nothing or which satisfies no links (null) is an end state
need an activeparty, activeregion, activeprocedure lists for Simulation
Simulation needs to track sections so it can know where to jump on end states
consider doing a using ID = byte where relevant
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO
consider decoupling Currency from Faction, and moving all Currncy into a HashMap instead
perhaps Slide with only one or no Line of Description should become a SlideTitle, vs a SlideContent

Procedure stuff:
for ProcedureDeclared, it can only be pressed for people who meet its filters
for ProcedureRepeating, automatically yield every ballot
after YieldEffect
if EffectBundle has a procedureID, then remove that procedure from active procedures (it is ProcedureImmediate)
apply effects



Simulation initialisation:
Roles + permissions,
Factions,
Procedures,
Balllots,
???
