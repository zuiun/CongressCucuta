display procedures now :skull:

convert pass/vetoes into declared procedures

i wish i could centralise fonts
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed

Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO -> this could be represented through "regional assent," forcing all regions (houses) to have a majority in favour
once i figure out Permissions stuff, i need to make Procedures work with them because I LOVE CANADA (or it could be Ballot Effect, boring but easier probably)

test the other Conditions (completed: And, Or, Always, Never)

not sure if state currency displays properly
test can speak (poland)
