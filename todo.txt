features:
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO -> this could be represented through "regional assent," forcing all "regions" (houses) to have a majority in favour -> that sounds like way too much work.
once i figure out Permissions stuff, i need to make Procedures work with them because I LOVE CANADA (or it could be Ballot Effect, boring but easier probably)
someday, consider implementing replacing factions

Testing:
other Conditions (BallotsCount : australia...)
ELECTIONS (region (leader : canada), appointed (ie random) : canada, shuffle : canada)
not sure if state currency displays properly (canada)
can speak (canada)
declared procedures (canada has division of chamber, need to test singledice, all elections (not appointed))
parties and factions - voting should only activate once for duplicates for people (canada)
replacing procedures

double check class vs struct
i wish i could centralise fonts
do not go back on end slide?
