i wish i could centralise fonts
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO
each new ballot should start with a blank slate (i.e. regenerate all information like permissions, majority needed from context), then compose permissions
Simulation needs a way to know if it's on a Ballot slide or not; once entering a Ballot slide, it needs to apply all Procedures, and once exiting, it needs to apply Results
clicking on a ballot vote link confirms the vote and adds it (or not) to the ballotsPassed
test the other Conditions (completed: And, Or, Always, Never)
double check class vs struct
once i figure out Permissions stuff, i need to make Procedures work with them because I LOVE CANADA (or it could be Ballot Effect, boring but easier probably)
the netherlands is a good way to test if the unique localisation roles work



Context Grid:
State Currencies
People ItemsControl (sorted by party (independents, eg heads of state come before parties), then region; faction leaders first):
[party, with currency if exists]
[region, with currency if exists; a well-formed simulation is not likely to have both party and region currencies]
Name [Roles] | pass/fail/abstain RadioButton (default to abstain) | available ProcedureDeclared Expander (opens left)

Ballots ItemsControl:
Ballot/Incident | pass-fail-abstain (successful option highlighted and coloured green/red)

Procedures Expander (opens up, covers entire Grid):
Governmental
Special
Declared

space-between equivalent:
<Grid>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <!-- Flexible space on the left -->
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
        <!-- Auto-sized content -->
        <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
        <!-- Flexible space between columns -->
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
        <!-- Auto-sized content -->
        <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
        <!-- Flexible space on the right -->
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
</Grid>



Procedure stuff:
for ProcedureDeclared, it can only be pressed for people who meet its filters
for ProcedureRepeating, automatically yield every ballot
after YieldEffect
if EffectBundle has a procedureID, then remove that procedure from active procedures (it is ProcedureImmediate)
apply effects
