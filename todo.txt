ELECTIONS (not sure if party (normal and leader), region (leader), appointed, or shuffle work)
gameplay loop:
context refreshes its state, queries all of its proceduresactive, and applies them -> create a ballot context once done
(users vote and do whatever)
vote is locked in
simulation context applies ballot result effect to itself

Procedure stuff:
proceduresActive should contain all ProcedureTargeted and ProcedureImmediate (at start); procedureDeclared does not get added
for ProcedureDeclared, it is only visible for people who meet its filters
upon starting a ballot, yield all proceduresActive and apply their effects
if EffectBundle has a procedureID, then remove that procedure from active procedures (it is ProcedureImmediate)



i wish i could centralise fonts
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO
each new ballot should start with a blank slate (i.e. regenerate all information like permissions, majority needed from context), then compose permissions
Simulation needs a way to know if it's on a Ballot slide or not; once entering a Ballot slide, it needs to apply all Procedures, and once exiting, it needs to apply Results
clicking on a ballot vote link confirms the vote and adds it (or not) to the ballotsPassed
test the other Conditions (completed: And, Or, Always, Never)
double check class vs struct
once i figure out Permissions stuff, i need to make Procedures work with them because I LOVE CANADA (or it could be Ballot Effect, boring but easier probably)
the netherlands is a good way to test if the unique localisation roles work



Context Grid:
State Currencies
People ItemsControl (sorted by party (independents, eg heads of state come before parties), then region; faction leaders first):
[party, with currency if exists]
[region, with currency if exists; a well-formed simulation is not likely to have both party and region currencies]
Name [Roles] | pass/fail/abstain RadioButton (default to abstain) | available ProcedureDeclared Expander (opens left)

Ballots ItemsControl:
Ballot/Incident | pass-fail-abstain (successful option bolded and coloured green/red)

Procedures Expander (opens up, covers entire Grid):
Governmental
Special
Declared
