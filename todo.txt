Features:
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO
-> this could be represented through "regional assent," forcing all "regions" (houses) to have a majority in favour
-> that sounds like way too much work. but whitlam my beloved
someday, consider replacing factions (would require reworking literally everything)

Testing:
other Conditions (BallotsCount : australia)
declared procedures (electionparty : australia, ballotlimit : malaysia, argentina [coup])
(make an actually robust test suite at some point...)

Convert (in order of how much I like them):
Australia (very difficult)
Malaysia
Argentine
Brazil
Finland
China?
Poland?
Spain?
Japan?
Hungary?
Germany?
