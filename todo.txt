bind title of SimulationWindow to state name
display textblock on FileWindow if file fails
Line needs to wrap overflow
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
many objects need to be convertible to Slides.
ownerID 0 is the state (eg Tension, Stability, etc), other ownerIDs refer to factions
lots of classes should really be structs
a ballot/result that links to nothing or which satisfies no links is an end state
linear slide, branching slide
simulation is just a slide iterator
need an activeparty, activeregion, activeprocedure lists for Simulation
all Data should eventually be readonly. these will need to have better constructors

Simulation order:
Intro slide (state, government type)
Context slide
Title slide (date, event, period)
Governmental procedures
Special procedures
Declared procedures
Titles slide (member, speaker)
Regions
Parties
Ballots list slide
Ballots
End results
Historical path slide
The End
