WE START WITH MAKING PROCEDURES!

bind title of SimulationWindow to state name
display textblock on FileWindow if file fails
Line needs to wrap overflow
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
many objects need to be convertible to Slides
ownerID 255 is the state (eg Tension, Stability, etc), other ownerIDs refer to factions
a ballot/result that links to nothing or which satisfies no links (null) is an end state
need an activeparty, activeregion, activeprocedure lists for Simulation
Simulation needs to track sections so it can know where to jump on end states
consider doing a using ID = byte where relevant



procedure types:
they must also be able to set permissions immediately upon being created... (this requires all roles are created first)
purely ballot-related (votes, currency; apply this to the beginning of the ballot)
declared (factions, currency, forced votes/changing who can vote; apply only during a ballot, must press a button; must have declarers)

differences between Governmental, Special, and Declared procedures:
Governmental: takes place at start, can be repeated, involve shuffling of factions
Special: repeated every ballot (affects votes, currency)
Declared: repeatably declared (changes factions, currency, votes)



Simulation order:
Intro slide (state, government type)
Context slide
Title slide (date, event, period)
Governmental procedures
Special procedures
Declared procedures
Titles slide (member, speaker)
Regions
Parties
Ballots list slide
Ballots
End results
Historical path slide
The End
