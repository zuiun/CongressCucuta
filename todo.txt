bind title of SimulationWindow to state name
display textblock on FileWindow if file fails
Line needs to wrap overflow
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
many objects need to be convertible to Slides.
ownerID 0 is the state (eg Tension, Stability, etc), other ownerIDs refer to factions
lots of classes should really be structs
