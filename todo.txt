i suppose now is a good time to start working on different types of slides
slides also need to have some sort of control interface
clicking on the SlideView's next would need to bubble up to the SimulationViewModel so it could handle the switch
Button names:
no button if no Link
Next if only one Link (it's linear)
Generate from Link.Condition if more than one Link (Branching)

bind title of SimulationWindow to state name
Line needs to wrap overflow
should SimulationWindow be fullscreen? maybe allow it to switch to smaller windowed
many objects need to be convertible to Slides
Australia is bicameral NOOOOOOOOOO
slides which yield null should be converted into slides without a next button
perhaps Slide with only one or no Line of Description should become a SlideTitle, vs a SlideContent
rethink whether Idx is an IDType or not
each new ballot should start with a blank slate (i.e. regenerate all information like permissions from context), so we don't have to do weird permissions compositions

Procedure stuff:
for ProcedureDeclared, it can only be pressed for people who meet its filters
for ProcedureRepeating, automatically yield every ballot
after YieldEffect
if EffectBundle has a procedureID, then remove that procedure from active procedures (it is ProcedureImmediate)
apply effects



Simulation initialisation:
Roles + permissions,
Factions,
Procedures,
Balllots,
???
